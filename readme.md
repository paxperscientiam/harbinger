What is?
===

Not much. `Harbinger` is just a thin wrapper around the `osascript` `display notification` command.


Usage
===
I've written `harbinger` so that one needn't worry about using quote marks (well, with some caveats).

```bash
harbinger <message>[,title][,subtitle]
```

`harbinger` can either be sourced or run directly as a script.

```bash
./harbinger.bash <message>[,title][,subtitle]
```



Examples
===
```
harbinger Donald John Trump will be removed from office,Impeachment and Conviction,High Crimes and Misdemeanors
```
